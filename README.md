"I met a programmer from an exquisitely confusing land,
Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of steel
Stand in the matrix. . . . Near them, on the binary,
Half sunk a shattered command line lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled text, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
And on the pedestal, these words appear:
My name is OrionSIlverStorm, King of Kings;
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level binary stretch far away.”
